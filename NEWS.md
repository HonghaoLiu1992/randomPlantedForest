# randomPlantedForest 0.2.1

* Add `glex` class to output of `predict_components()`, for extended functionality available with [`glex`](https://github.com/PlantedML/glex).
* Add `target_levels` vector to output of `predict_components()` to aid multiclass handling.
Keeping track of levels is somewhat awkward since column names of `$m` need to be identifiable
regarding the target level.

# randomPlantedForest 0.2.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
